# Comparison of Tree-based ML methods
The project aims to compare the performance of Tree-based methods for anomaly detection problems i.e., the labels are heavily skewed. For this, we use data from credit card fraud detection taken from Data-Flair's [website](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-machine-learning-project-credit-card-fraud-detection/). They also perform their own detection, whereas we take a more comparative approach. The methods chosen are Decision tree, Random forests and Gradient Boosted trees.  

The code is implemented in R as an R-Notebook titled `comparison.Rmd`, along with the knitted HTML version. For viewing the process, use the HTML file and for reproduction of results, use the notebook. The data can be downloaded directly from Data-Flair's website
